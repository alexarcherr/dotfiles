# Then listening command gives you a listing of processes listening on some port and listening smth greps this for some pattern.
# Having this, it's quite easy to ask about particular process, e.g. listening dropbox, or port, e.g. listening 22.
# lsof command has some specialized options for asking about port, protocol, process etc. but personally I've found above function much more handy, since I don't need to remember all these low-level options. lsof is quite powerful tool, but unfortunately not so comfy to use.

if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    sudo lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -n -P
elif [ $# -eq 1 ]; then
    sudo lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -n -P | grep -i --color $1
else
    echo "Usage: listening [pattern]"
fi
